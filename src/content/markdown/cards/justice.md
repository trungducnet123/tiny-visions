reading: Justice suggests that it's time to take a step back and assess the situation with an unbiased perspective. Consider the cause and effect of your actions and those of others involved. Are you being honest with yourself and others? Are you treating others with fairness and integrity? It's time to take responsibility for your actions and make decisions based on the truth. Ask yourself if you're standing up for what's right, and whether you're treating others in a fair and just manner.
