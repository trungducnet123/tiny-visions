reading: The World represents a sense of fulfillment and wholeness, indicating the end of a journey and the beginning of a new chapter. It encourages you to reflect on your accomplishments and celebrate your successes. At the same time, it also reminds you that every end marks a new beginning, and encourages you to stay open and curious about what comes next. Some questions you could ask yourself are - what have I learned from my journey so far? What aspects of myself have I integrated or developed along the way? How can I continue to grow and evolve from here?
